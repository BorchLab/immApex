\usage{
hill_q(q)
}
\arguments{
\item{q}{Numeric order of diversity.  Common values:
*0* (richness), *1* (exp(*H′*)), *2* (inverse Simpson).}
}
\value{
A **closure**: `hill_q(q)` returns a function that takes a
  vector of counts and yields the corresponding ^qD.  The returned
  function is vectorised over its input.
}
\description{
Returns a *function* that computes the Hill diversity of order *q*
(also called the “effective number of species”):
}
\details{
\deqn{^{q}D \;=\;
   \left( \sum_{i} p_i^{\,q} \right)^{1/(1-q)}, \quad q \neq 1}

For *q = 1* the formula is undefined; the limit is
\deqn{^{1}D = e^{H'}}.
